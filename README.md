The **Aurelionite** is now a proper boss fight, having a new set of attacks and different phases during the fight, it's harder but it also gives you different rewards and a bonus that lasts during the entire run after defeating it.

![Items](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RayDimn/Risk_Of_Rain_2_Expand/main/Banners/ItemsBanner.gif)

In total, the Modpack currently adds **100+ new items** to the item pool, with various rarity's including new ones.

![Gameplay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RayDimn/Risk_Of_Rain_2_Expand/main/Banners/GameplayBanner.png)

Although many changes have been made, the core gameplay of the game it still largely the same with additions being made, they are some of the following...

## Survivors Changes
Most of them were left untouched with the exception of 4.

  * **Commando** - Phase Round has been buffed to allow it to proc Bands.
  * **Huntress** - Recieve a passive skill `(Huntress Momentum)` allowing her to rely less on crit items.
  * **Artificer** - Recieve 13 new skills.
  * **Captain** - His beacons now are a rechargeable skill, having a cooldown of 60 seconds.



## Interactables  
**All the interactables** `(Scrappers, Printers, Shrines)` are now faster to use than the vanilla game, **but they are not instant**.  

**NEW Shrine of Repair:** Allows you to repair one consumed/untiered item **or** revert back a void item to its original non-void version.  
 
**Teleporter Event** is now 15% faster. `(This change makes the lunar item **Focused Convergence** still be effective and not be considered entirely useless)`

**Void Fields** are now a viable option to do during your runs, having the fog damage being reduced and the timer it takes to complete each Void Field Cell reduced. `(40s for the first 4 cells, 50s for the next 4 cells, 60s for the last cell)`



## Multiplayer  
You can now have up to 8 players in the game. `(You can change it up to 16, but the game gets very unstable. **I don't recommend changing this.**)` 

You can now join people during a game. Typing `/list_survivors` in the game chat will display a popup list of available survivors. To choose one, press the `scoreboard key` and click on the survivor you want to play.  

Survivors that join during a game will also receive items and level up.

You can also revive teammates at any time now, but at the cost of your own health, so be careful.

* <details><summary><b>Bazaar changes and balance</b></summary>

  - Bazaar now spawns 6 chests that can be bought with coins.
  - You can exchange your lunar coins to regular coins up to 3 times.
  - Every player can only buy 3 items from the chests. `(doesn't matter the rarity of them)`
  - The chests also have a limited amount of items determined by their rarity. `(Common = 5, Uncommon = 3, Legendary = 2, Boss / Planet = 1)`
  - You can still buy every lunar item in the shop, from the lunar buds.

</details>


## Drones/Minions  
Drones had their AI tweaked to be more reliable, making them more useful in general.  

Drones now also have an upgrade system:  
- You can have up to **2 drones of the same type**.  
- Acquiring another drone of the same type upgrades one of the two,  **enhancing its stats** `(damage +100%, health +100%, fire rate +10%, skill cooldown +50%)`. 



## Quality of life / Bug Fixes
There are way too many for me to list all of them, here are some notable ones...

- **Drop items:** You can now drop items from your inventory by clicking on them, except for Lunar and Void items.
- You now have a small status list below the objective panel.
- The teleporter will create a icon whenever it's found for all the players.
- Items display in survivors have been disable, this boosts the FPS and fix issues with modded survivors with some items. `(Can be re-enable by disabling the mod entirely on the mod list)`
- Chests now become invisible after being open.
- leveling up now grants you some extra stats `(Movement speed +0.015, Attack speed +0.01, Health regen +0.1)`.
- ***And many more...***
