## Recommended way to install the ModPack
It is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** that you install the ModPack by using the **Thunderstore code** below for the **Thunderstore Mod Manager**, that way is more ensured you also get all the custom config files i tweaked to try to give the best experience with all the Mods!

| Thunderstore Code | 0197c21e-1821-93d8-f71a-241fd79763a7

Although not necessary, it's also recommended that you own both DLC's.

![About](https://github.com/RayDimn/Risk_Of_Rain_2_Expand/blob/main/Banners/AboutBanner.png)

**Risk Of Rain 2 Expand** is a Modpack created to serve as a expansion of the game, giving a variety of quality of life additions, bug fixes as well as overall new content to the game, all that while trying to stay true to the original core of the game.

* **DISCLAIMER:** Most of the features of the Modpack can be tweaked or disable, all the changes that i have made for this Modpack were given by the mod options itself, so if there is something you would like to change/disable/enable it's possible. You just need to look for it!

![Gameplay](https://github.com/RayDimn/Risk_Of_Rain_2_Expand/blob/main/Banners/GameplayBanner.png)

Although many changes have been made, the core gameplay of the game it still largelly the same with additions being made, they are the following...

## Survivors Changes
Most of them were left untouched with the exception of 3.

  * **Commando** - Phase Round has been buffed to allow it to proc Bands.
  * **Huntress** - Recieve a passive skill (Huntress Momentum) allowing her to rely less on crit items.
  * **Captain** - His beacons now are a rechargable skill, having a cooldown of 60 seconds.



## Interactables  
**All the interactables** (Scrappers, Printers, Shrines) are now faster to use than the vanilla game, **but they are not instant**.  

**Teleporter Event** is now 15% faster. (This change makes the lunar item **Focused Convergence** still have an effect on it's time and not be entirely useless).  

**Shrine of Repair:** Allows you to repair one consumed/untiered item **or** revert a void item to its original rarity.  

**Drop items:** You can now drop items from your inventory except for Lunar and Void items.  



## Multiplayer  
You can now have up to 8 players in the game. (You can change it up to 16, but the game gets very unstable. **I don't recommend changing this.**)  

You can now join people during a game. Typing `/list_survivors` in the game chat will display a popup list of available survivors. To choose one, press the `scoreboard key` and click on the survivor you want to play.  

Survivors that join during a game will also receive items and level up.  



## Drones/Minions  
Drones had their AI tweaked to be more reliable and aggressive, making them more useful in general.  

Drones now also have an upgrade system:  
- You can have up to **2 drones of the same type**.  
- Acquiring another drone of the same type upgrades one of the two, **doubling its stats** (damage, health, fire rate, and skill cooldown).  



## Quality of life / Bug Fixes
There are way too many for me to list it, so just know that they are there :)
